# <a id="1"></a>Lecture 1. Introduction

## <a id="1A"></a>Introduction

### <a id="1A1"></a>Overview

- Cognitive Science (CogSci): Study of mind and intelligence
- Main concerns:
  - Identify resources used
  - Understand how they are deployed
- Classic view (1950s–1980s):
  - Symbolic representations
  - Symbol processing
- Recent challenges:
  - Adequacy of symbol processing
  - Brain studies
  - Consciousness, emotions
- Aims of the course:
  - Examine classic CogSci as an account of human thinking and intelligence
  - Examine challenges to classic CogSci
- For now:
  - The CogSci paradigm
  - History of CogSci

### <a id="1A2"></a>The Cognitive Paradigm

- Cognitive Scientists disagree on the nature of thinking and intelligence
- **Central Thesis**: Thinking is like computation (in a digital computer)
  - Information is represented (data structures)
  - Calculations are performed
- Note: The thesis is an analogy, not a claim of physical resemblance between brains and PCs
- The thesis is a paradigm (Kuhn) more than a theory; it tells researchers …
  1. What to investigate,
  2. What sorts of theories to test, and
  3. How to test and evaluate them.
- For CogSci:
  1. Investigate intelligent behaviours
  2. Theorize about mental representations and procedures
  3. Test using computational models, experiments, etc.

#### <a id="1A2a"></a>Intelligence

Q: What activities require intelligence?
- Typical answers include `recreational challenges`, `argumentation`, `technological work`
- In classic CogSci: intelligence is any activity in which `knowledge` and `expertise` plays a major role
- Intelligence is **knowledge**-intensive

#### <a id="1A2b"></a>Mental Representations and Procedures

![abc](imgs/1a2b_abc.jpg)
- Mental representation - statements:
  - Block A is on block B.
  - Block B is on the ground.
  - Block C is on the ground.
  - Block C is right of block B.
- Mental procedures - rules:
  - To have block x on block y, place block x on top of block y.
  - To place block x on top of block y, remove other blocks from on top of y, pick up block x, move it on block y and let go of block x.
- Make a plan to spell "CAB"

#### <a id="1A2c"></a>Theory Assessment in Cognitive Science

- Theory: `model` or `explanation` of how an intelligent activity occurs
  - Claim about mental representations and procedures, e.g., statements and rules
- Model **confirmed** if performance matches human behaviour (disconfirmed otherwise)
  - This approach is referred as **cognitive modeling** - the operation of the computer program models or imitates the course of human thinking
- CogSci is highly interdisciplinary
  - Different disciplines employ different testing methods, e.g., brain scans in neuroscience

#### <a id="1A2d"></a>Summary

- Central thesis: Thinking is like computing
  - CRUM: Computational-Representational Understanding of Mind
- CRUM is a paradigm rather than a theory
  - Intelligence is knowledge-intensive
  - Produced by mental representations and procedures
  - Theories are testable through simulation, experiment, etc.
- Evaluation of CRUM depends on
  - Record of success or failure of CRUM theories
  - Performance relative to other paradigms
  - Prospects for future success

### <a id="1A3"></a>History of Cognitive Science

#### <a id="1A3a"></a>Prehistory

- Basic questions:
  1. What do you know and how do you know it? (**epistemology**)
  2. What kind of thing is a mind? (**metaphysics**)
  3. How does a mind give rise to thinking? (**psychology**)
- Some responses:
  - Plato (ca. 400 BC): grasp of ideas, hydraulic analogy
  - Locke (ca. 1700): possession of stattements, blank paper analogy
  - Watson (ca. 1920): S-R arcs, switchboard anaology
  - Weiner (ca. 1940): control configurations, rangefinder analogy

#### <a id="1A3b"></a>The Cognitive Revolution

- 1940s: Turing, electromechanical computers, computer analogy
- 1950s:
  - Miller: short term memory (7&plusmn;2 chunks)
  - Newell & Simon: General Problem Solver
  - Chomsky: syntax as mental representation
- Some general historical trends:
  1. Thinking and intelligence have often been associated with information processing
  2. Information processing technology has often been used as a source of inspiration for theories of cognition
